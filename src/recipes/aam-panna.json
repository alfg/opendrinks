        "1 Sugar",
        "2 Unripe Green Mango",
        "3 Cardamom",
        "4 Fresh Mint",
        "5 Black Salt"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Choose the raw mangoes which are tart.",
        "You can keep the skin on before boiling the mangoes. It gives a very distinct flavour to the Panna.",
        "Peeling the skin before boiling makes the process very easy.",
        "If the Panna is not very tangy, you can add some lemon juice to it.",
        "Boil Mango with mild heat in 1 cup of water.",
        "You can also roast mango before boiling if needed for crispy taste.",
        "The subtly smoky flavour in this drink will take it to the next level.",
        "Strain into the prepared glass.",
        "Garnish with a parsley sprig, 2 speared green olives and a lime wedge and a celery stalk (optional)."
