        "Build the cocktail. Place the bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg white in a cocktail shaker. Do not add ice yet.",
        "Dry shake the cocktail. Seal the shaker and shake vigorously for 10 seconds. (This is referred to as a 'dry shake.' It's good for incorporating the egg white before adding ice to the shaker.)",
        "Shake again with ice. Add ice, seal again, and shake for 7 to 10 seconds more to chill.",
        "Strain the cocktail. Fit a Hawthorne strainer over the top of the shaker and pour the cocktail through a fine-mesh strainer into a coupe glass. This is referred to as a 'double strain' and this method is used to catch any ice shards or pulp from the fresh-squeezed lemon juice.",
        "Garnish and serve. Garnish with a speared maraschino cherry."
