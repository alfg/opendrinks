    "description": "This is a non-alcoholic version of a unique drink idea from Brussels. Lemon-lime soda replaces the gin for a mellow, neutral base and the addition of almond syrup to the oranges has an almost candy-like quality. Dry citrus notes and a bit of fizz save the drink from being cloyingly sweet. You’ll never miss the alcohol in this virgin cocktail!",
