        "Transfer the baking dish to the freezer and freeze at least 6 hours, or overnight. (The alcohol in the mixture will keep it a slushy texture instead of freezing solid.) Blend the mixture again until it comes to a fluffy texture.",
        "To serve, place the blended mixture into a glass. Then pour a splash of rose into each glass (this step is important: it gives the final texture and brings in the character of the rose). If desired, garnish with strawberries and serve."
