        "1. Fill a slow cooker or pot with Zeffer’s Apple Crumble Cider. Add the sugar, the sliced orange rounds, add finally the cinnamon sticks and star anise.",
        "2. Cover the pot or slow cooker and heat until the flavours meld. If using the slow cooker leave for 2-3 hours on low or warm.",
        "3. Serve in a glass or mug garnished with additional orange slices and cinnamon stick.",
        "Note: A slow cooker does the double duty of both mulling the cider and keeping it warm for hours, making it a good option for winter entertaining."
