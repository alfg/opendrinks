    "description": "The Spagliato (pronounced with a silent g) is a traditional variation on the Negroni. In 1972, Mirko Stocchetto at the Bar Basso in Milan added sparkling wine instead of the gin by mistake to a Negroni. He then realized that this variation had some sense and this humble mistake led to the creation of a classic cocktail that is still enjoyed all around the world today, and to its name: in fact, in Italian 'sbagliato'  means mistaken. A fantastic variation on a traditional cocktail that leads to a much lighter, brighter taste, making it perfect for a pick me up at the start of a meal, or any time of the day.",
