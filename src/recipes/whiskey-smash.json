  "description": "Like Mint Juleps? You’ll love the Whiskey Smash, a citrusy 19th-century cooler. Legendary bartender Dale DeGroff at the Rainbow Room in New York modified the classic recipe by adding muddled lemon wedges. DeGroff calls the citrus-and-mint combination the perfect cocktail for those who say they’ll never drink whiskey.",
