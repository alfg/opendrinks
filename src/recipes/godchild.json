    "description": "The Godchild, which is classified as a dessert cocktail, is perfect for novices as it is simple to make and smooth and easy to drink. This is a variation of the classic Godfather cocktail, which is a mix of Scotch whisky and Amaretto and was named after Marlon Brando, who had a penchant for this drink and was obviously best known for is role as the head of a mafia family in The Godfather movies. If you fancy something a little more adventurous, you can pour the Godchild cocktail over a bowl of vanilla ice cream, for a boozy dessert.",
