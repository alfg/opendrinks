    "description": "The beauty of The Marriage of Figaro cocktail is the use of fig-infused bourbon. It is spectacular, and a natural flavor pairing that you'll find fascinating. It's definitely a homemade infusion, but while you have it, think of using it to spice up other favorite whiskey cocktails, such as the Manhattan, for a unique twist.",
