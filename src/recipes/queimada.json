      "We place the aguardiente and sugar in a clay pot of our own to burn, in the proportion of 150 grams for each liter of brandy.",
      "We reserve 2 tablespoons of sugar to plant the fire, so we peel the lemons and the orange and throw them into the clay container",
      "Now comes the most important part. In a ladle we put the 2 tablespoons of sugar with a little brandy and we start a flame on the spoon, when the flame starts we bring it to the container of the queimada so that it begins to burn.",
      "We add a handfull of coffee beans, the ones that fit in one hand. In this way, the drink will have a toasted color, also thanks to the caramel that is going to be formed with the sugar.",
      "Wait for the fire to burn out and cheers!"
