    "description": "Allow me to introduce you to Wedang Uwuh, a traditional herbs drink from Jogyakarta, Indonesia. Wedang means drink, and uwuh means trash. So, wedang uwuh means “trash drink”. They call it wedang uwuh because some of the ingredients are leaves that fall from the tree. They would not pick the leaves that are still on the tree because the leaves are still green and usually have a bitter taste.The drink contains a variety of leaves like cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves leaves. Another ingredient is wood from the secang tree (that usually  can be found in Imogiri cemetery-known as Royal Cemetery), ginger and lump sugar.",
