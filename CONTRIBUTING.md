## üç∏ Submit a Drink Recipe
The [/src/recipes/](/src/recipes/) directory contains all the drink recipes as a JSON file. Add your own by following the process below:

* Fork the project
* Create a new json file named after the drink
* The filename should be all lowercase and hyphens only. `example-drink.json`
* Use this template to add your drink recipe:

    "ingredients": [
        "<Ingredient 1>",
        "<Ingredient 2>",
        "<Ingredient 3>"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "<Step 1>",
        "<Step 2>",
        "<Step 3>"
    ],
    "image": "<drink-name.jpg>",
    "source": "<url if available>" 
}
```
